# Idol Studio

by Yiheng Niu and Zhengtian Zhang

Many idols sing songs when they are streaming, primarily virtual idols. Here is a great way to
listen to your favorite idols' songs without viewing their stream recordings repeatedly! We
abstract the songs from streaming and make them available to you! You can search for
songs and add them to your own playlists! You can also play them in any order you like.

## Iteration 2

So far, Yiheng has implemented:

- Home screen
- Tab navigation
- Fetch songs from Firebase Storage
- Player which supports play, pause and play next song
- Redux integration to support global state management

Zhengtian has implemented:

- Playlist screen
- Authentication
- Stack navigation between pages other than the home page
- Profile, with camera use to take picture for user's avatar
- Playlist details page, where songs in the specific playlist shows (mock data for now)
