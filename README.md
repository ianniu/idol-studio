# Idol Studio

by Yiheng Niu and Zhengtian Zhang

Many idols sing songs when they are streaming, primarily virtual idols. Here is a great way to
listen to your favorite idols' songs without viewing their stream recordings repeatedly! We
abstract the songs from streaming and make them available to you! You can search for
songs and add them to your own playlists! You can also play them in any order you like.

## week 1

Yiheng created the Home Screen and the tab navigation. The Homne Screen contains a search box and some songs recommanded for users.

Zhengtian created the Playlist Screen. The Playlist Screen contains all the playlists user created, each contains multiple songs.
